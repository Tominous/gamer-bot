# What is Gamer?
Gamer is a games bot that was originally made for Discord Hack Week 2019. It uses Discord's built-in features to display a current total of nine different games that can be played in chat. Some of the games can be played in singleplayer, server multiplayer, or cross-server with random players if you can't find a friend to play with.
